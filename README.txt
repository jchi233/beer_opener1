This file is a guide to creating a device which opens tabs on aluminum cans.
It contains the following directories:

   Parts 
	- This is a directory which contains all of the required material
	to print the device. There are several different versions of the
	device. It happens that the most recent version is considered the
	'best', but bear in mind that this is an entirely relative sort
	of analysis. Due to printer limitations, the parts are mostly
	under 20g, with about a 10inx10in max base size.

   Arduino
	- This directory houses the code which operates all of the parts.
	Each directory inside houses code which performs distinct
	functions. I will not make any claims that these directory names
	well describe their contents. There are some files which only do
	small things, and some files which additively operate the code.
	As the numbering increases, the complexity of the routine does
	too. So 'file3' is generally better than 'file2'.

   Instructions
	- This directory is the full set of instructions that are
	required to build the device. Step by step instructions exist
	here in a .txt file and in a latex .pdf with pictures to match.
